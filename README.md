# About
Project for Advanced Python course @ ii uwr

Production server: https://yt.rflorczak.eu

# Known issues
* Reversing or randomizing long playlist takes long time (due to lack of background workers) which can lead
to connection timeouts with reverse proxy or user reloading the page because of no quick response.
* User token verification sometimes doesn't redirect to Google for reauthentication (results in error 
500) -- reloading page fixes problem.

# Installation (for Debian based distros)
```bash
sudo apt-get install python python-pip python-django
pip install google-api-python-client
pip install django-widget-tweaks
```

Don't forget to change secrets and addresses in `playlist_tools/settings.py`
as well as in `pltools/views.py`.

### Running in production (wsgi)
First run:
```bash
sudo apt-get install apache2 apache2-dev python-dev
git clone https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/mod_wsgi
cd mod_wsgi && python setup.py install
```
Then go to project directory and:
```bash
./manage.py collectstatic
mod_wsgi-express start-server playlist_tools/wsgi.py
```
Finally create `secrets.json` file in main directory and fill it with secrets
generated by Google API secrets with YouTube Data API enabled (can be generated at:
https://console.developers.google.com).
